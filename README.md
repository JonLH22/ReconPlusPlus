# ReconPlusPlus
A recon script taken from TCM's bug bounty course. The intention is for it to be expanded and built upon! :)

This script has a few programs that can be used to do recon on web targets. It is a pretty open and endless script as there are copious amounts of recon programs you can add to it of course.
The intention is to get it to be an effective and comprehensive recon script.

It creates several folders for the target website and the screenshots/info you gather. 
Hope this helps and happy hunting! :)

Shoutout to TCM/Heath. 

Current programs added to the script:

- Subfinder
- Assetfinder
- Amass
- Httpprobe
- Gowitness
- Nmap
- Nikto
